# Automatic Checkbox Reordering Plugin for Obsidian

> As of Obsidian version 1.8.3, numbered lists are now automatically renumbered as a built-in feature. Therefore, this plugin now only supports automatic checkbox reordering.

The Automatic Checkbox Reordering plugin automatically sorts checked items to the bottom.

## Installation Steps

1. In Obsidian, go to **Options → Community plugins → Browse** and search for **Automatic Checkbox Ordering**.
2. Click **Install** and enable the plugin.

## Limitations

-   **Modifier Keys**: To avoid conflicts with keyboard shortcuts, the sorting feature is temporarily disabled when modifier Keys (`Ctrl`, `Command` on Mac, or `Alt/Option`) held down during editing.
