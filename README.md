# Automatic Checkbox Reordering Plugin for Obsidian

> As of patch 1.8.3 of Obsidian, the automatic list renumbering this plugin was initially designed for has been removed, as numbered lists are updated automatically. This plugin now only supports automatic checkbox reordering.

The Automatic Checkbox Reordering plugin automatically sorts checked items to the bottom.

## Installation Steps

1. In Obsidian, go to **Options → Community plugins → Browse** and search for **Automatic Checkbox Ordering**.
2. Click **Install** and enable the plugin.

## Limitations

-   **Modifier Keys**: To avoid conflicts with keyboard shortcuts, the sorting feature is temporarily disabled when modifier Keys (`Ctrl`, `Command` on Mac, or `Alt/Option`) held down during editing.
